        Fear is like a fire. If you can control it, it can cook for you. It can heat your house. If you can't control it, it will burn everything around you and destroy you. Fear is your friend and your worst enemy. <br>

        Truth be told, you could threaten me all day long and I still wouldn’t care. <br>

        Books can also provoke emotions. And emotions sometimes are even more troublesome than ideas. Emotions have led people to do all sorts of things they later regret-like, oh, throwing a book at someone else. <br>

        To forgive or not to forgive... are those my only choices? <br>

        You have to write the book that wants to be written. And if the book will be too difficult for grown-ups, then you write it for children. <br>

        Fairy tales are more than true: not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten. <br>

        Due to my outstanding performance during our last mission, I have been promoted to a full-time member of the group! That means you all should listen to my opinions from now on. For example, I think that before going to sleep, we should all hunt a few animals and put their heads on spikes all around our camp in order to ward off invaders! <br>

        I saw something the other day that I thought was a human arm. Then I came closer and saw that it was just a cadaver arm. <br>

        A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools. <br>

        To shield children right up to the age of 18 from exposure to violent descriptions and images would not only be quixotic, but deforming; it would leave them unequipped to cope with the world as we know it. <br>

        I found myself thinking about President William McKinley, the third American president to be assassinated. He lived for several days after he was shot, and towards the end, his wife started crying and screaming, "I want to go too! I want to go too!" And with his last measure of strength, McKinley turned to her and spoke his last words: "We are all going.” <br>

        Reality continues to ruin my life. <br>

        The beginning of love is the will to let those we love be perfectly themselves, the resolution not to twist them to fit our own image. If in loving them we do not love what they are, but only their potential likeness to ourselves, then we do not love them: we only love the reflection of ourselves we find in them. <br>
        3-19-19 <br>
        A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you. <br>
        3-18-19 <br>
        Our journey starts in this long, long, steep slope. <br>
        3-17-19 <br>
        Don’t apologize. If you did...then it would be like it was all a lie. I want to hold those memories we had dear. The fun times...The painful times...All of it. So please, don’t apologize. <br>

        Why did you do all this for me?' he asked. 'I don't deserve it. I've never done anything for you.' 'You have been my friend,' replied Charlotte. 'That in itself is a tremendous thing.’ <br>
        3-14-19 <br>
        I’m glad you’re here with me. Here, at the end of all things… <br>

        He realized that he had lost sight of something important. No matter what turn he took, he should have kept singing. Even if his songs couldn’t save the world, he could still sing songs for her. Don’t ever lose sight of what’s important to you. <br>
        3-11-19 <br>
        Do not lose to the obstacles that you will meet in the future. <br>

        What are you so hesitant about? It’s right in front of you and you’re wavering? You gotta be reckless and take whatever you can! <br>

        This is how it works. I love the people in my life, and I do for my friends whatever they need me to do for them, again and again, as many times as is necessary. For example, in your case you always forget who you are and how much you're loved. So what I do for you as your friend is remind you who you are and tell you how much I love you. And this isn't any kind of burden for me, because I love who you are very much. Every time I remind you, I get to remember with you, which is my pleasure.<br>

        Two wrongs don't make a right, but they make a good excuse. <br>
        3-1-19 <br>
        Life is a series of natural and spontaneous changes. Don't resist them; that only creates sorrow. Let reality be reality. Let things flow naturally forward in whatever way they like. <br>

        Yesterday I was clever, so I wanted to change the world. Today I am wise, so I am changing myself. <br>

        Religion has actually convinced people that there's an invisible man living in the sky who watches everything you do, every minute of every day. And the invisible man has a special list of ten things he does not want you to do. And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place, full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish, where he will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke and scream and cry forever and ever 'til the end of time! <br>

        Yeah, we can keep her. I've always wanted a pet.... THAT COULD KILL ME!

        Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and it may be necessary from time to time to give a stupid or misinformed beholder a black eye.

        Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. <br>
        2-19-19 <br>
        Better to get hurt by the truth than comforted with a lie. <br>
        2-18-19 <br>
        All God does is watch us and kill us when we get boring. We must never, ever be boring. <br>
        2-17-19 <br>
        Good friends, good books, and a sleepy conscience: this is the ideal life. <br>
        2-16-19 <br>
        Do I contradict myself? Very well, then, I contradict myself; I am large -- I contain multitudes. <br>
        2-15-19 <br>
        Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently. They're not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About the only thing you can't do is ignore them. Because they change things. <br>
        2-14-19 <br>
        Saying 'I notice you're a nerd' is like saying, 'Hey, I notice that you'd rather be intelligent than be stupid, that you'd rather be thoughtful than be vapid, that you believe that there are things that matter more than the arrest record of Lindsay Lohan. Why is that?' In fact, it seems to me that most contemporary insults are pretty lame. Even 'lame' is kind of lame. Saying 'You're lame' is like saying 'You walk with a limp.' Yeah, whatever, so does 50 Cent, and he's done all right for himself. <br>
        2-13-19 <br>
        You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper is a white guy, the best golfer is a black guy, the tallest guy in the NBA is Chinese, the Swiss hold the America's Cup, France is accusing the U.S. of arrogance, Germany doesn't want to go to war, and the three most powerful men in America are named "Bush", "Dick", and "Colin." Need I say more?

        Everything changes the moment you realize you are precisely as valuable as everyone else. <br>
        2-11-19 <br>
        I won’t have to go through any unnecessary pain. But… at the same time… I might have kept myself from seeing things that were very important...by always looking down. Even things that I really, really wanted. <br>

        He appears to have nothing more on his mind than ramen… <br>

        I’m not sure where I’m going to end up, but I’ll be damned if I go back where I’ve been. <br>
        2-8-19 <br>
        A picture's worth a thousand words they say. But the words are inside a picture, hiding away. You are a picture, because I don't care about your look or your name. I just care about what is in your frame. <br>

        We're going to meet a lot of lonely people in the next week and the next month and the next year. And when they ask us what we're doing, you can say, We're remembering. That's where we'll win out in the long run. And someday we'll remember so much that we'll build the biggest goddamn steamshovel in history and dig the biggest grave of all time and shove war in it and cover it up. <br>

        Deer are like horses, only twice as strong and three times as evil. <br>
        2-3-19 <br>
        My courage and my resolution is firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing. <br>
        2-2-19 <br>
        You can't stop your mind; the damn thing just keeps right on going. <br>
        2-1-19 <br>
        We will continue to march, even if everything shatters, because today Germany hears us, and tomorrow, the whole world. And because of the Great War, the world lies in ruins, but devil may care, we build it up again.
        1-31-19 <br>

        We get the small truth first. Good! We keep him, and we value him, but all the same we must not let him think himself all truth in the universe. <br>

        Love is not sufficient. It never has been. Stories that claim otherwise are lies. There's always SOMETHING after happily ever after. <br>

        There will be pain for us all; but it will not all be pain, nor will this pain be the last. We, and you too, will have to pass through the bitter water before we reach the sweet. But we must be brave of heart, and unselfish, and do our duty, and all will be well! <br>

        No drug, not even alcohol, causes the fundamental ills of society. If we’re looking for the source of our troubles, we shouldn’t test people for drugs. We should test them for stupidity. <br>

        Change is… it’s what we get. I guess that’s my problem-I’m always trying to beat the clock, outrun the universe… like nothing can change me as long as I change first. I feel like I’m in this river, just getting swept along… and if I hold on to anyone, if I’m holding on for dear life, I’m not getting anywhere. I’m stuck. I never wanted to get stuck… I’ve never been good at holding on. <br>

        The truth is always an abyss. One must — as in a swimming pool — dare to dive from the quivering springboard of trivial everyday experience and sink into the depths, in order to later rise again — laughing and fighting for breath — to the now doubly illuminated surface of things. <br>

        “I do not understand the ways of this tiny god; BUT YOU, YOU WHO ARE YOUNGER AND KNOW THESE COMPUTERS, YOU MUST SPEAK TO THIS TINY GOD AND COMMUNICATE UNTO ME ITS ELECTRONIC WISDOM, FOR I AM BUT MORTAL AND DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS TO "GOOGLE IT." <br>

        "Kids today! They've been ruined by <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Dungeons & Dragons, comic books, rock music, not working in the steel mill for sixteen hours a day</span>, computers and technology!" <br>
        12-11-18 <br>
        Fuck you fucks and the fucks you fucked in on! <br>
        12-10-18 <br>
        You stole him with your advanced American slut technology! <br>

        We are no longer the knights who say Ni! We are now the knights who say ekki-ekki-ekki-pitang-zoom-boing! <br>
        12-8-18 <br>
        So many books, so little time. <br>
        12-7-18 <br>
        “Are we letting her drink beer again?" <br>
        "Hell yes we are, and it's hilarious.” <br>

        Success is not final, failure is not fatal, it is the courage to continue that counts. <br>
        12-5-18 <br>
        Maybe all these desperate clashing feelings I'm feeling are just random brain activity, maybe I'm just delusional. But there are things that I miss, and things that I feel like I should be seeing and feeling every time I turn around, and I just keep turning and turning and turning, and there's nothing. <br>
        12-4-18 <br>
        People can’t concentrate on blowing other people to pieces properly if their minds are poisoned by thoughts suitable to the twenty-fifth of December. <br>
        12-3-18 <br>
        Music is not a fucking soda. It is not a fucking insurance rate. It is not a fucking T-shirt. It is the only real religion that is worth devoting your soul to. It is the last remnant of the primal scream, the funeral dirge, and the wedding march. It is the light that keeps me out of the shadows, and it is the reason my immortal soul is not in dire straits. <br>
        12-2-18 <br>
        Oh, hey, maybe I should have mentioned that my friends are retarded douchebags. <br>
        12-1-18 <br>
        Every time you look up at the stars, it’s like opening a door. You could be anyone, anywhere. You could be yourself at any moment in your life. You open that door and you realize you’re the same person under the same stars. Camping out in the backyard with your best friend, eleven years old. Sixteen, driving alone, stopping at the edge of the city, looking up at the same stars. Walking a wooded path, kissing in the moonlight, look up and you’re eleven again. Chasing cats in a tiny town, you’re eleven again, you’re sixteen again. You’re in a rowboat. You’re staring out the back of a car. Out here where the world begins and ends, it’s like nothing ever stops happening. <br>
        11-30-18 <br>
        Remember how far you've come, not just how far you have to go. You are not where you want to be, but neither are you where you used to be. <br>
        11-29-18 <br>
        Hunter! Point at the mice! <br>
        11-28-18 <br>
        The decent moderation of today will be the least of human things tomorrow. At the time of the Spanish Inquisition, the opinion of good sense and of the good medium was certainly that people ought not to burn too large a number of heretics; extreme and unreasonable opinion obviously demanded that they should burn none at all. <br>
        11-27-18 <br>
        Rockin' and rollin' my way through town <br>
        Yeah, baby, I get around <br>
        Make mine murder, paint the town red <br>
        Squash any spider, hanging by a thread <br>
        11-26-18 <br>
        “Don’t worry, Jiro. The kami would never attack us this close to home… Jiro?” <br>
        -Hoto, temple guardian, last words <br>
        11-25-18 <br>
        Home is behind, the world ahead, <br>
        And there are many paths to tread <br>
        Through shadow, to the edge of night <br>
        Until the stars are all alight. <br>
        Mist and shadow, cloud and shade, <br>
        All shall fade, all shall fade. <br>
        11-24-18 <br>
        No one has a perfect life. Everybody has something that he wishes was not the way it is. <br>
        11-23-18 <br>
        In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on. <br>
        11-22-18 <br>
        Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever. <br>
        11-21-18 <br>
        No more fear. No more failure. No more death. No more! <br>
        11-20-18 <br>
        A full belly is worth little where the mind is starved. <br>
        11-19-18 <br>
        All that is gold does not glitter, <br>
        Not all those who wander are lost; <br>
        The old that is strong does not wither, <br>
        Deep roots are not reached by the frost. <br>
        From the ashes a fire shall be woken, <br>
        A light from the shadows shall spring; <br>
        Renewed shall be blade that was broken, <br>
        The crownless again shall be king. <br>
        11-18-18 <br>
        A room without books is like a body without a soul. <br>
        11-17-18 <br>
        Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that. <br>
        11-16-18 <br>
        The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man knows himself to be a fool. <br>
        11-15-18 <br>
        It's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring. <br>
        11-14-18 <br>
        The women looked pretty, except when you got near them. <br>
        11-13-18 <br>
        Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe. <br>
        11-12-18 <br>
        Now, think about this. You could walk across the street against a traffic light and get a summons for jaywalking, but you could walk up to a police officer and say “I want to rule the world,” and there’s nothing he can do about it, that is not a crime. Anybody can want to rule the world. <br>
        11-11-18 <br>
        It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light. <br>
        11-10-18 <br>
        My supply of shticks is inexhaustible! <br>
        11-9-18 <br>
        Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence win championships. <br>
        11-8-18 <br>
        We fit like gloves. I think I’m a genius and you agree with me. You’re there for me, and that’s good enough. <br>
        11-7-18 <br>
        A test?! How am I supposed to do a test when I never pay attention in class?!?! <br>
        11-6-18 <br>
        “There’s never anyone home at our house, Noriko-san.” <br>
        “That’s right, because my house embraces liberalism.” <br>
        11-5-18 <br>
        We do not suddenly fall on death, but advance towards it by slight degrees. We die every day. <br>
        11-4-18 <br>
        Crazy’s always better with company. <br>
        11-3-18 <br>
        May you find peace with the knowledge of the good your life has produced rather than the evil into which you were once thrust. <br>
        11-2-18 <br>
        I am on my way to hell, that is, if I am on the right road. <br>
        11-1-18 <br>
        Besides, where better to put a village than where no one is looking?  And where better to place a path than where no one expects it? <br>
        10-31-18 <br>
        This isn't the first time I've worn dead bodies as clothes. Might be the most fun I've had though. Top three at least. <br>
        10-30-18 <br>
        Did it just get badass in here? <br>
        10-29-18 <br>
        We’re stuck on a giant floating sphere in the middle of an endless universe. It’s okay to feel a little lost sometimes. <br>
        10-28-18 <br>
        Some inner voice told me to be cool. I went full fangirl instead. <br>
        10-27-18 <br>
        The only thing you really need to know is the location of the library. <br>
        10-26-18 <br>
        Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind. <br>
        10-25-18 <br>
        I don’t know about everything, not by a long shot. But I do try to keep an open mind, and you’d be surprised by what wanders in sometimes. <br>
        10-24-18 <br>
        If you can believe in Santa for years, you can believe in yourself for a bit. <br>
        10-23-18 <br>
        It’s better to eat an egg then not to. <br>
        10-22-18 <br>
        Many say only God can judge. I don’t think He issues restraining orders. <br>
        10-21-18 <br>
        Hey, laser lips! Your mama’s a snow blower! <br>
        10-20-18 <br>
        Man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed, but not defeated. <br>
        10-19-18 <br>
        The closer one gets to the light, the stronger one’s shadow gets. <br>
        10-18-18 <br>
        “Ooh, shiny! Let’s pull off the chain and take her with us.” <br>
        Ukl, Gruul raider, last words <br>
        10-17-18 <br>
        Many a book is like a key to unknown chambers within the castle of one's own self. <br>
        10-16-18 <br>
        Oh, I just knew you could do it! And both of you are still alive, with intestines intact and all!  Marvelous! <br>
        10-15-18 <br>
        It's a man's curse to see himself only as that which he lacks, and it's his blessing to have friends that have the wisdom to see him as he really is. <br>
        10-12-18 <br>
        Every spirit builds itself a house; and beyond its house, a world; and beyond its world a heaven. Know then, that the world exists for you; build, therefore, your own world. <br>
